# credit-card-approval-ml
We built a machine learning-based classifier that predicts if a credit card application will get approved or not, based on the information provided in the application.
While building this credit card approval predictor, we learned about common preprocessing steps such as feature scaling, label encoding, and handling missing values.
We implemented five different machine learning models, optimized the hyperparameters, and evaluated the performance using the accuracy score and comparing the performance between train and test data.
We have used pythonâ€™s machine learning libraries to implement machine learning algorithms.
